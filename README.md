👋 Hey, I'm Jake

I'm a 19-year-old developer from the UK who fell in love with Computer Science because it’s the closest thing to turning ideas into reality. I love the feeling of taking something that only exists in your head and engineering it into something structured, fast, and actually useful. I first picked up video games when I tried Mario Kart Wii and soon later got an xbox 360 for my birthday in 2011. Since then, Ive been interested in how the things we rely on and intereact with everyday are actually made and after I got into PC gaming, my love for computer science went crazy.

🔥 What I’m Into

Full-stack development
I like building things end-to-end — clean UI, efficient backend logic, and scalable structure. Projects like Macrofy push me to design software that’s simple, aesthetic, and actually functional.

Systems programming & architecture
I’m obsessed with understanding how things work under the hood: concurrency, OS behaviour, optimisation, and the patterns that make real systems reliable.

Security, tooling & automation
Anything that hardens systems or removes repetitive work is my playground.

🛠️ What I'm Working On

Macrofy — a full fitness & nutrition platform with calculators, account systems, dashboards, trackers, and a minimalist design philosophy.

Aegis Security System — a modular, versioned security framework I’m building (starting with Aegis: Kestrel).
I’m designing it with:

layered authentication logic

real-time safety checks

structured versioning using UK birds (Kestrel → Merlin → Sparrowhawk, etc.)

an emphasis on reliability, clean architecture, and maintainability
Aegis is my way of levelling up from “project building” to “system designing.”

Sharpening my CS fundamentals — algorithms, system design, and writing maintainable, scalable code.

📚 Currently Learning

Advanced JS/TS patterns & cleaner front-end architecture

Backend structuring, authentication flows, and reducing technical debt

Better system-level reasoning (design patterns, data flow, modularity)

🎯 What Drives Me

I want to build proper software — not throwaway scripts, but systems that feel intentional, polished, and thought-through. CS gives me focus and a sense of progress, and I’m aiming to build a career where I get to solve real problems and refine my craft long-term.
